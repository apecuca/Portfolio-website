# Portfolio Website
Hello! My name's Marco and this is my personal website, a simple static portfolio website made using HTML, CSS, Javascript and the React Framwork.

The website is available [here](https://apecuca.github.io/Portfolio-website/).


## About me
My full name's Marco Bossle Villanova and I'm a Game Developer, currently working on my own Game Engine. I've worked on a few projects (less than I would've like to) using various technologies. You can find out more about said projects on the website ;)
